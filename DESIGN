let's use this file for keeping track of design ideas for sparklemotion.
the file is formatted for emacs' outline-mode (http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/OutlineMode)

* Data input
Eventually support multiple streams?
Single stream is fine for now.

** Format
Text

** Entity
Data is grouped by entity.  I.e., three FoB sensors attached to shoulder, elbow,
and wrist would be grouped and represent an arm entity.

** Timing
Not worrying about this for now, will investigate how to fix the FPS in Panda3d
and then assume input is sync'd.

** Coordinates
*** FoB
With FoB data, the position of the sensors from FoB space to SM (Sparkle Motion)
space is a translation.  Euler angles of sensors needs to be worked out.

* Visualization modes
As data from multiple sensors is to

** Points
Simple 3d points, rendered as spheres.  Defined by: XYZ postion, RGBA color, and
real number scale

** Connected segments
An ordered collection of connected points, rendered as line segments.  Defined
by: [XYZ position], RGBA color, and real number scale

** Textures
Hmm, could be code that produces a texture based on some parameters

* Camera control
The camera will be fixed on a centroid that can be moved.  Left and right arrow
keys rotate the camera around the centroid, which is aligned with the Y-axis.
Up and down arrow keys translate the camera towards or away the centroid.  The
'W' and 'S' keys move the centroid along the Y-axis, 'E' and 'D' along the
X-axis, and 'R' and 'F' along the Z-axis.
